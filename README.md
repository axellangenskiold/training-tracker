# **Training Tracker**

## **Overview**
A python script to see your training progress daily.
Tracks weight, date and activities.


## How to use

### Step 1
#### Start by cloning the repo

#### Option 1 (APPLE USERS)
Create a note in your Apple Notes app with the headline "THE ARC"  
  
This way you can use write the notes on your iPhone and when you run the script on your MacBook, the note automatically syncs.

####
- At the beginning of the file, put: Y2024
- For every activity, put (D)D/(M)M: ACTIVITY, WEIGHT kg (if ACTIVITY is "l√∂pning" or "run", put the distance you ran, eg. 9km (or miles))
- Adding WEIGHT is optional!
- If there is a new year, put Y "THE NEW YEAR", eg. Y2025

## Example
Y2024  
29/12: run, 8km
30/12: gym, 93.5kg  
31/12: golf  
Y2025  
1/1: gym, 92.5kg  
2/1: run, 5km
