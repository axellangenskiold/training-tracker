# **Training Tracker**

## **Overview**
A python script to see your training progress daily.
Tracks weight, date and activities.


## How to use
Create a txt file with the following format:
- At the beginning of the file, put: Y2024
- For every activity, put (D)D/(M)M: ACTIVITY, WEIGHT kg (if ACTIVITY is "l√∂pning" or "run", put the distance you ran, eg. 9km (or miles))
- Adding WEIGHT is optional!
- If there is a new year, put Y "THE NEW YEAR", eg. Y2025

## Example
Y2024  
29/12: run, 8km
30/12: gym, 93.5kg  
31/12: golf  
Y2025  
1/1: gym, 92.5kg  
2/1: run, 5km  

## Specs
**Have the .txt file in the same folder as your script**
