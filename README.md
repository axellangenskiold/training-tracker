## **Overview**

#### A python script to see your training progress daily.  
#### Tracks your weight over time, aswell as the activities you did.  
#### The script shows a graph over you progress  

## How to use

### Step 1

#### Start by cloning the repo

### Step 2

#### Option 1 (APPLE USERS)

Create a note in your Apple Notes app with the headline "THE ARC"

This is where you will track your workouts

This way you can use write the notes on your iPhone and when you run the script on your MacBook, the note automatically syncs.

#### Option 2

Write directly to the .txt file or similair file (google docs for example) and copy to the .txt file in the repository every time you run it

### Step 3

#### Write in your file (notes or other) using the following format:

- At the beginning of the file, put your title
- For the beginning of year put Y"THE YEAR", e.g. Y2024
- For every activity, put (D)D/(M)M: ACTIVITY, WEIGHT kg (if ACTIVITY is "l√∂pning" or "run", put the distance you ran, eg. 9km (or miles))
- Adding WEIGHT is optional for workouts
- Adding distance for runs are mandatory
- If there is a new year, put Y"THE NEW YEAR", e.g. Y2025

## Example

Y2024
